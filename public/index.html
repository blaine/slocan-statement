          <p>
            The following is intended as a starting point, a first draft towards
            establishing a shared charter that would serve to protect, support,
            and enrich the nascent Fediverse.
          </p>

          <p>
            This text is intended to be received in the spirit of iteration and
            is presented absent any fundamentalism about the ideas within. We
            don't have great tools for usable decentralized collaboration on
            text, so while I have misgivings about placing it in a space that is
            only accessible by engineers, it is available to be
            <a href="https://github.com/blaine/slocan-statement">forked</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I encourage anyone to use this text as a basis for their own
            statement, but my hope is that we can build towards a collective
            statement for the whole fediverse. I encourage the use of the
            <b>#slocanstatement</b>
            hashtag on the Fediverse if you post a derivative work elsewhere.

          <h1>A Charter for the Fediverse</h1>

          <p>
            The federation of online services, known as &ldquo;the
            Fediverse&rdquo;, agree to the following:
          </p>

          <p>
            By operating a network that connects to the <b>fediverse</b> by way
            of recognizing and leveraging the <b>freedoms</b> of
            <a href="#freedom-identity"><b>online identity</b></a> and
            <a href="#freedom-communication"><b>communication</b></a> and
            agreeing to principles of
            <a href="#interoperability"><b>interoperability</b></a
            >:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>We agree to maintain, in perpetuity, an open interface</b> that
              ensures the continuation of these freedoms of online identity and
              communication in accordance with the principles of
              interoperability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>We agree that software and standards</b> written to support
              federated systems will be published with
              <b>licenses and agreements</b> that require adherence to this
              charter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>We agree to obtain necessary license(s)</b> from users in order
              to <b>permit the redistribution of content</b> created by members
              across the fediverse provided that correct attribution to the
              original creator is maintained.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>We agree to neither federate nor provide services</b> to any
              organization that, having agreed to these principles, later
              withdraws from this charter.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            We agree these principles in order to ensure that online
            <b>communities have the autonomy to self-determine</b> and
            <b>individuals have the ability to freely communicate</b>, free from
            the tendency of dominant nodes in the network to leverage network
            effects as a monopolizing strategy.

              The
              <a name="freedom-identity">freedom of online identity</a> &mdash;
              to use and present a federated online identity (a
              &ldquo;Name&rdquo;) to any federated system &mdash; is considered
              a fundamental right.

              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  Organizations that grant names to individuals agree to do so
                  in trust.
                </li>

                <li>
                  To the extent made possible by protocols or agreement, they
                  will allow the transfer of the management of an
                  individual&apos;s name to another federated organization of
                  the individual&apos;s choosing.
                </li>

                <li>
                  They agree to make available to the best of their ability the
                  facilities associated with naming, in particular the ability
                  to freely perform discovery of the mechanisms for
                  communication.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              The
              <a name="freedom-communcation">freedom of communication</a>
              &mdash; the ability for individuals and communities to share
              information between federated systems &mdash; is considered a
              fundamental right.
            </li>

            <li>
              The
              <a name="interoperability">principles of interoperability</a> are
              as follows:

                <li>
                  The protocols that enable and facilitate federated identity
                  and federated communication shall be agreed to by independent
                  standards bodies and must be free of legal obligations or
                  copyright or patent claims.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Federated instances agree to conform to the standards in order

                <li>
                  Neither (i) nor (ii) prevent the creation of new standards or

          <h1>Community Mutual Support</h1>

          <aside>
            <p>
              This section is likely to be the most controversial, however I
              believe it to be important to include in this first draft as a way
              of accounting for the immense shared project that is the
              Fediverse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many institutions exist that support the free and open internet.
              However, those institutions exist at the will of the organizations
              that have profited so immensely from the network, not by way of
              any formal obligation. Furthermore, the Fediverse is an explicitly
              international project, so national forms of taxation cannot
              explicitly address this need.
            </p>
            <p>- b.</p>
          </aside>

          <p>In recognition of</p>

          <ol>
            <li>the importance of the wider fediverse</li>

            <li>
              the labour and costs associated with creating and maintaining
              federated systems, standards, and shared infrastructure
            </li>

            <li>
              the ongoing need to defend the principles of federated communities
            </li>

            <li>
              to wholly independent trusts, foundations, or non-profits whose
              charters are to support the continued maintenance and development
              of code, policy and legal structures associated with and in
              support of the fediverse in accordance with this charter
            </li>
            <li>at intervals according to the prevailing custom</li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>an amount according to the prevailing custom.</li>
            <li>
              This obligation <em>should</em> be construed to have a high
              priority vis other interests, as it is intended as a form of
              voluntary taxation in support of the immense benefits conferred by
              participating in the Fediverse.
            </li>

        <section>
          <h1>Caveats</h1>

          <p>
            Nothing above should be construed to prevent federated communities
            from restricting or limiting federation in order to protect
            themselves or their members against abuse or to apply community
            standards. However, federated identities must be made available
            online according to the wishes of the individual, and the ability
            for any individuals to communicate using their assigned identifiers
            must not be restricted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>Future Considerations</h1>

          <p>
            In light of the many diverse possibilities afforded by the fediverse
            and the complex relationship between content created by individuals
            and community-generated datasets, this statement intentionally omits
            discussion of data portability, copyright, privacy, content and
            community moderation, and any other jurisdictionally necessary
            questions of legal compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            The omission of the above should <em>in no way</em> be construed to
            diminish the importance of those subjects and discussions. Rather,
            each of those topics represents a fundamental topic unto themselves.

            This text is intended to represent an initial draft of something
            that sits somewhere between the
